    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data through simple commands. SQL is essential for querying large amounts of data efficiently and organizing it in tables with rows and columns. It supports operations like filtering, sorting, joining tables, and aggregating data. Popular database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server use SQL for data management. Learning SQL is important for developers, data analysts, and anyone working with data storage and retrieval.</p>
