    <p>MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database designed to store data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional tables. This allows it to handle unstructured or semi-structured data easily and scale horizontally across many servers. MongoDB is widely used for applications that require fast, flexible data storage such as real-time analytics, content management, and big data. It supports powerful querying, indexing, and aggregation features to work efficiently with large datasets. Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, making it ideal for evolving data models. Its ease of use and scalability have made it a favorite among modern developers.</p>
