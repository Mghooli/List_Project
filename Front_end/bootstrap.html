    <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework used to build responsive and mobile-first websites quickly. It provides pre-designed layouts, buttons, forms, navigation bars, and other UI components. With Bootstrap, developers can create clean, professional-looking designs without writing a lot of custom CSS. It also includes JavaScript plugins for features like modals, carousels, and dropdowns. The framework uses a 12-column grid system to make layout design easy and flexible. Bootstrap saves time and ensures consistency across different browsers and screen sizes.</p>
