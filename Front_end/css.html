    <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style and design web pages created with HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of a website. With CSS, developers can make websites more attractive and user-friendly. It separates content (HTML) from presentation, which makes design easier to manage. CSS can be written directly in HTML or in separate .css files. It's a powerful tool for creating responsive, modern web designs that look great on all devices.</p>
