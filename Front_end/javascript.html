    <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. While HTML structures a page and CSS styles it, JavaScript adds functionality, such as animations, pop-ups, form validation, and real-time updates. It runs directly in the browser and responds to user actions like clicks or keypresses. JavaScript is an essential part of web development, often used with HTML and CSS. It can also interact with servers, fetch data, and update the webpage without reloading it. Most modern websites and web apps rely heavily on JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience.</p>
