    <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and encourages clean, reusable code. Django comes with many built-in features like authentication, admin panels, form handling, and database integration, reducing the need to code everything from scratch. It's known for its security, helping developers avoid common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Django is ideal for both small projects and large-scale applications. Its motto, "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines," reflects its focus on speed and reliability.</p>
