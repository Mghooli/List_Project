    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It’s built on Chrome’s V8 engine and is widely used for building fast and scalable server-side applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling many simultaneous connections. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager). Developers use Node.js for building web servers, APIs, real-time apps, and microservices. Its ability to use JavaScript both on the client and server simplifies development.</p>
