    <p>Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence â€” meaning code written in Java can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is used to build web applications, mobile apps (especially Android), desktop software, and enterprise systems. Java is known for its robustness, security, and scalability, making it a top choice for large-scale applications. Its syntax is similar to C++, but it's simpler and more memory-managed. Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere", which increases code portability. With a large community and powerful libraries, Java remains a core language in software development.</p>
